// As you complete each challenge, RUN THE CODE to ensure it works. You can do this by
// running `node <filepath>`. If you are in this directory, you'd run `node for.js`.
  
// Challenge 1
// Use a for statement to log to the console all even numbers between 25 and 75.
var evenNumbers = []
for (i = 25; i < 75; i++) {
  if(i % 2 ==0){
    evenNumbers.push(i);
  }
}
console.log(evenNumbers);

// Challenge 2
// Use a for statement to log to the console a complete sentence stating the weather using the Array below:
var weather_options = ["sunny", "snowy", "freezing", "partly cloudy", "drizzly"]

for(var i = 0; i < weather_options.length; i++){
  console.log("The weather today is " + weather_options[i])
}

// Challenge 3
// Use a for statement to log to the console only the words that are exactly 3 characters in length
var words = ["car", "bike", "bus", "van", "scooter", "truck", "rv"]

// for loop is setting a counter as 0, as long as the counter is less than
// the length of the words array, it will execute the if statement in the code block
for(var i = 0; i < words.length; i++){
  if(words[i].length == 3){
    console.log(words[i])
  }
  // The if statement is checking the length of the element(word), if the length is 
  // equal to 3, it will be output in to the console. 
}

// ðŸ“¹ Record yourself live-coding and talking through any ONE of the challenges. 
  // The recording doesn't have to be the first time you are solving the problem. 
  // Use technical vocabulary and explain each part to demonstrate your understanding!
