# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I feel comfortable with the basics though feel I have more to learn and could always use more practice.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
During this challenge, I experienced both productive and unproductive struggle. I felt a little overwhelmed when I was in my unproductive struggle phase. I learned that I need to step away and clear my mind for a little.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I still need to practice a few more iterations on for loops, I do need to adjust some aspects of my calendar in order to complete assignments succesfully.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
For the questions I do have, I can use the google first, if I'm reaching a point where I am in a unproductive phase, I will reach out to cohort mates in the small group and use the resources available to me at home as well.
